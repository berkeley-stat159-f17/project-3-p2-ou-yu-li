<p>This is what we expected. There is basically no trend.</p>
<p>What about the relationship between hours worked per week and age? We
think there might be a negative relationship, as younger people tend to
have the capacity and motivation to work longer hours. There might also
be a downward quadratic relationship, in which people in their middle
ages work the hardest. In either case, we definitely do not think that
the elderly work the most.</p>

<p>This result is rather surprising. There seems to be no, or even a
somewhat positive trend, between the number of hours worked and age.
This is very counterintuitive. It is possible that the occupation itself
determines the number of hours worked. We do see that the higher the
age, the fewer data points above 60.</p>
<p>This brings up a question. How are so many individuals working 60 hours
or above? There are even many individuals working around 100 hours! That
is absurd. Letâs look more deeply into this.</p>

<p>There is a clear difference between hours worked and marital status for
the overall dataset. Widowed individuals seem to work the fewest number
of hours. This is understandable. We thought that married individuals
would work fewer hours than non-married individuals since these married
individuals would have family commitments, but the reverse is true.
Maybe married individuals work more to get more pay to support their
family?</p>
<p>For the overworked individuals, in the most cases, there does not seem
to be a relationship between hours worked and marital status. For
overworked individuals, those in the army had the highest average number
of hours worked. It is not surprising that those who are working in the
army work the longest. Serving our country is a hard job.</p>

<p>Overall, it seems like farmers and fishers work the most. These are not
that surprising: Farming and fishing are very hard and take a long time.
We need to be more appreciative of these occupations for their hardwork.
On the other hand, other services and private house services occupations
work the least.</p>
<p>For overworked individuals, farmers/fishers and armed forces worked the
most, which is what we saw before. Transportation/moving, sales, and
tech-support also work quite a lot.</p>
