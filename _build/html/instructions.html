<h1>Project 3: original data analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#project-3-original-data-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As discussed in class, project #3 will be a free-form version of work along the lines of what you did in project #2.  The goal of the project will be to develop a complete analysis of a dataset that you find online, ask some interesting questions from it, and share your complete set of results in a well documented manner, using the practices we've been developing during the course.</p>
<div class="section" id="team-setup-and-logistics">
<h2>Team setup and logistics<a class="headerlink" href="#team-setup-and-logistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Due date:</strong> the last commit should be no later than <em>Wednesday December 13th, at 11pm local (Pacific) Time</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Teams:</strong> the project is to be completed with the same team of three that you used for hw 3, the dataset selection.</p>
<p><strong>Team names:</strong> use the same team name as for hw3: your repo should be named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">p3-XX-YY-ZZ</span></code>, where XX, YY and ZZ are the first two letters of each member's last name.</p>

<h3>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Depending on the size of your data, you may choose to include it in the repository or not (use your judgment - up to a few dozen megabytes it's not a problem, something in the Gigabyte range is too big to put into a repo). If the data isn't  included locally, your code should access it remotely and cache it adequately for subsequent executions.  If you don't include the data in the repository, consider the implications of doing so for long-term reproducibility: is the source you are using a reliable one? Will it be there in 10 years?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="functional-structure-of-your-code-and-testing">
<h3>Functional structure of your code and testing<a class="headerlink" href="#functional-structure-of-your-code-and-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You should identify steps amenable to be put into standalone functions and write a proper function for those, with a complete docstring describing their inputs, as I've shown in some of our examples (the Numpy project offers <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/example_numpy.html">detailed examples of high-quality docstrings</a>).</p>
<p>You may choose to put a few analysis functions into a pure python file that you import separately, make the choice that you find cleanest/most fluid for your workflow.</p>
<p>Whether you do it in a notebook or python scripts, make sure to write at least a few test for utility functions that you write.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this is a <em>requirement</em>. You must structure your code to include at least two functions, that you test and document properly (feel free to use more as your analysis dictates).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis-notebooks-and-supporting-code">
<h3>Analysis notebooks and supporting code<a class="headerlink" href="#analysis-notebooks-and-supporting-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Break down your analysis into as many notebooks as is reasonable for convenient reading and execution. There is no hard and fast rule for this, just as there isn't for how many paragraphs or figures a good scientific paper should have. You should consider readability, execution time, total notebook length, etc, as criteria in your decisions.  <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2017/11/14/what-is-a-computational-essay">This essay</a> by Stephen Wolfram, the creator of Mathematica (part of the inspiration for the Jupyter Notebook) has some good thoughts on what makes a well written computational narrative.</p>
<p>Consider how to &quot;chain&quot; your analyses with intermediate results being stored so they don't need to be recomputed from scratch each time. Also, be mindful of saving key figures you may want to reuse in your report to disk, so the main narrative notebook can reuse them for display and discussion.  Look back at the instructions for project 2 if you need a refresher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="main-narrative-notebook">
<h3>Main narrative notebook<a class="headerlink" href="#main-narrative-notebook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Write a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">main.ipynb</span></code> notebook that summarizes and discusses your results. It can contain figures referenced from disk or simple summary information (for example if you want to display part of a dataframe) from variables read from disk, but <em>no significant computations at all</em>. Think of this as your &quot;paper&quot;.</p>
<p>Discuss the assumptions you can make about the data to justify your analysis.  You have no control over the original data acquisition and measurement, and for many of you this project will likely fall under the broad purview of <em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em>.  If you propose any statistical hypothesis/model in your analysis, discuss your justifications, considering how the data was acquired.</p>
<p>Your final report, when completed, may well diverge your initial plan as submitted in hw3. Discuss any changes you made from this plan and why you chose to pursue new questions or modify your original ones.</p>

<h3>Reproducibility support<a class="headerlink" href="#reproducibility-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Environment: like in Projects #1 and #2, provide an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">environment.yml</span></code> file that creates an environment with all necessary dependencies to run your analysis.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>: you will also create a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">env</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all</span></code> targets, similar to that of Project #1. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">env</span></code> target should make the environment with all necessary libraries, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all</span></code> should run all notebooks.</li>
<li>Don't forget to control your random seeds for anything that has a stochastic component.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="good-repository-practices">
<h3>Good repository practices<a class="headerlink" href="#good-repository-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code>: see instructions therein.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LICENSE</span></code>: you should explicitly state which licensing conditions apply to your work (see <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/">Github's help</a>). I strongly suggest looking at Victoria Stodden's <a class="reference external" href="https://web.stanford.edu/%7Evcs/papers/ijclp-STODDEN-2009.pdf">ENABLING REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH:
LICENSING SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION</a>. For a short summary, her <a class="reference external" href="https://web.stanford.edu/%7Evcs/talks/VictoriaStoddenCommuniaJune2009-2.pdf">slides</a> can be useful. She suggests a &quot;Reproducible research standard&quot; that licenses code, data and text/media materials in comparable terms that maximize resharing potential while providing due credit guarantees for the original authors.</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.gitignore</span></code>: provide a git ignore file that prevents the automatic inclusion of unwanted files.  This also helps you avoid noisy <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> output that lists things you know you won't actually want to put under git's control.</li>
