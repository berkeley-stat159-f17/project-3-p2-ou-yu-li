    "The dataset we work on is named `adult.csv` (1994, UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository), which consists of the demographic information (i.e. age, work class, education, race, sex, etc.) about adults with an occupation. We also aim to forecast whether or not an individual makes more than \\$50 thousand dollars per year from the rest of his or her demographic information. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose this dataset because while many papers have cited this data set, they have mostly been done in a machine learning context of attempting to increase the classification accuracy of whether an individual makes more than $50 thousand dollars per year. There has been no study done to actually look into **the relationship between different explanatory variables**. For example, does one's gender affect how many years of education they obtain? What about one's race? These questions are essential, not only to understand the American society of 20 years ago, but also to understand that of today."

    "The dataset comprises the demographic information about 32561 individuals (rows), each of which is characterized by 15 different attributes (columns) including age, work class, education, race, sex, etc. Missing values in workclass, occupation, and native country exist in 2399 rows. After removing all rows with missing information, we derive and utilize a **cleaned dataset**, whose summary statistics changes little from the raw dataset. "

    "A couple of initial observations of the dataset are listed as follow: \n",
    "* The age distribution of the cleaned dataset is **skewed to the right**. Our explanation is that children do not have occupations and that people leave their occupations at a certain age (i.e. 60-70 yrs old). \n",
    "* The \"years of education (since 4th grade)\" distribution has **2 peaks**, which denote that the individual finishes his or her high school and college education, respectively. Relatively few people in the cleaned dataset have an education level that is lower than high school or higher than college (i.e. Master, PhD). Back in 1994, graduate schools have not yet become prevalent, while most people have had the chance to graduate from high school. \n",
    "* About **one half** of individuals in the cleaned dataset were married, about one third had never been married. This would by no means embody that one third of the Americans never get married, in that most of the data were from people in their 20s and 30s. It is reasonable that they first had an occupation and then got married. \n",
    "* About 85% of individuals in the cleaned dataset self-identified as White. It is likely that the **85%** includes Hispanics too. This gives us a striking evidence that in 1994, there were far less immigrants than there are today in the United States. In a 2010 census (on Wikipedia), around 72.4% of the US population are white.\n",
    "* About **two thirds** of individuals in the cleaned dataset were male, while the other one third were female. Our explanation is that in 1994, female labor participation was still much lower than that of today. Now around 47 percent of labor force in the US is female.\n",
    "* Conclusion: the graphs below show us the univariate distributions of labor frequency with respect to age, education background, marital status, ethnicity and sex. The labor statistics of sex and ethnicity, in particular, are quite different from those of today given that the US is becoming more inclusive."

    "The following graph shows the comparative distribution of occupations between males and females. A few gaps (when male/female scores a percentage that **at least doubles** that of the other sex) are recorded as follow:\n",
    "* Males are much more likely to engage in craft repair (i.e. auto mechanic), handling/cleaning (i.e. street cleaner), farming/fishing (i.e. farmer), protective services (i.e. guard), transport (i.e. bus driver), and armed force (i.e. soldier). From these results, males engage more in professions that require **body strength and mechanical skills**, which makes intuitive sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Females are much more likely than males to engage in administrative clerical roles (i.e. secretary), private house services (i.e. housekeeper), and other services that are not explicitly stated (i.e. waitress). From these results, females engage more in professions that require **care and attentiveness**, which also makes intuitive sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other occupations, such as executive managerial roles (i.e. CEO), professions with specialty (i.e. hairdresser), technical supports (i.e. AT&T worker) and sales (i.e. salesman), have close percentages of males and females."

    "We then compare the occupation distributions by race. Given that multiple ethnicities are recorded in the cleaned dataset, we show the different distribution patterns (of different ethnicities) in a graph of 5 subplots. Some observations are as follow:\n",
    "* Around 15% of the individuals identified as White and Asian/Pacific Islander have **executive/managerial roles**, while this percentage of other ethnic groups is significantly lower. These two groups may possess better opportunities than other groups, or it may show an inherent **bias of society**. More detailed study needs to be conducted to vindicate or to refute this observation.\n",
    "* For the Black group, **other services** and **administrative clerical roles** are almost twice as frequent as other occupations, while for the White group, the occupation distribution spreads nicely across different categories. This, again, may show the inherent bias of society mentioned above.\n",
    "* The most common occupation for the Asian/Pacific Islander group is \"**professions with specialty**\". This can be reflective of the fact that immigrants from this ethnic group often come to the US with a specialty, and that the Amercian society is more willing to accept Asian immigrants with a technical skill.\n",
    "* The most common occupation for the Amer/Indian/Eskimo group is **craft repair**. Individuals from this ethnic group are likely to be talented craft makers. \n",
    "* The **armed-forces** occupation has a very small sample. This is probably because it does not really count as an occupation and there are a few exceptions. In the cleaned dataset, no one from the Asian or the \"Other race\" ethnic group falls into the \"armed-forces\" category, in that they were likely to serve as new immigrants back in 1994."

Regression method is used in this section of our analysis, given that we can now display two different quantitative variables on a single scatterplot.\n",

Intuitively, there should be a slightly negative correlation between these two variables, given that younger people have the capacity and motivation to work longer hours than old people. Moreover, linear regression might not be the best regression method in this case. It is probable that there is a **downward quadratic relationship**, in which people in their middle ages work the hardest. Although in the actual case, the linear regression method shows a slightly positive slope which is very counterintuitive, we definitely do not consider that the elderly work the most. "
